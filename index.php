        <h2>Why I Chose Interior Design</h2>
        <p>I have always had an interest in the arts, but never thought it would be a career path.

            Throughout high school, I had taken a few art and architecture classes to stimulate my interest

            as more of a hobby.  Using art as an outlet, I fell in love with the sciences.  This love stemmed

            from my senior year Anatomy and Physiology course and stimulated my decision that I wanted

            to pursue a career in the sciences and help people and animals.</p>
        <p>At the start of my college career, I indulged in a full course load of classes that guided

            me on a science path, but still undecided on the route I wanted to take.  Taking the prerequisite

            classes for a Natural Science major of my freshman and sophomore year, I slowly started to

            struggle and question my decisions. This struggle made me realize I needed to research other

            career paths that allowed me to help people or animals.  Taking a career test and talking to

            advisors, I explored the careers that most interested me.  After the research, I proceeded with

            caution on a focus in interior design.  Having an interest, I was recommended to read an article

            about designing for the wellness of individuals.  This same process of design was present in a

            crisis resource center through Common Ground, a crisis intervention agency, at an event where

            I was a volunteer.   I was taught that the building was designed specifically to help the people

            the center serves who have cases of crisis and or mental illness.  The design of the building had

            many curvilinear lines present and a neutral color scheme with accents of blues and greens to

            provide a more calming and stress free environment.  Designing for the wellness of individuals

            is scientific in a way with respect of the concern for their health.</p>
        <p>This scientific background excited me and made me realize I could have a career with

            both sciences and arts.  But still being skeptical, I didnâ€™t want to jump in a different major too

            quick.  To see if I wanted to pursue a different major or continue on my science route, I enrolled

            in a study abroad to Kenya through the Zoology program and an online Interior Design course

            during the summer.  As much as I loved science, animals, and my trip to Kenya, Zoology or the

            science route was not a fit for me.  I was not as excited as I should be when taking the science

            courses as with when I participated in the Interior design online course.  I was ready to fully

            indulge in a new major because I was excited to learn and identify the elements and principles

            of design and how to design a functional space to benefit an individual.
        </p>
        <p>I felt like I found my true calling and passion in interior design.  Before I was accepted

            into the interior design upper division, I was able to obtain an internship for that spring semester

            and summer.  I had at my internship with DBI Business Interiors, a Haworth dealer that designs

            office spaces, for over a year..  Through this experience, I have gained a lot of knowledge that

            has helped me with many projects for courses and has given me networking opportunities.

            Words cannot even describe the excitement when I was able to put my name on my first

            AutoCAD drawing file that I had drawn for a designer.  Working for this company made me

            realize that I love working with commercial interiors because of the ability to provide healthier

            design solutions to a larger group of people.  In the future or after I graduate I would like to

            design commercial spaces in healthcare, hospitality, or office spaces that will help me with

            receiving my NCIDQ.  I also have an interest in ergonomics and would be willing to attend

            graduate school to become specialized to design better working situations for people in

            everyday life.  The opportunities in this field are limitless in regards to numerous job prospects

            that are available.  You really can do what you love the most and help people at the same time.</p>
